## Setting Up the 'casino_venv' Virtual Environment

The 'casino_venv' virtual environment is used to isolate and manage project-specific dependencies for our casino-related project. Below are instructions on how to create and activate this virtual environment.

### Creating the Virtual Environment

To create the 'casino_venv' virtual environment, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal on your operating system.

2. Navigate to the main location of your project or the folder where you want to create the virtual environment.

3. Execute the following command to create the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv casino_venv
   ```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

Once the virtual environment is created, follow these steps to activate it:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  casino_venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source casino_venv/bin/activate
  ```

When you activate the virtual environment, you'll notice that the terminal prompt changes to indicate that you are working within 'casino_venv'.

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it at any time using the following command:

```bash
deactivate
```

Please note that while working in the 'casino_venv' virtual environment, any dependencies you install and modifications you make to the project will only affect this isolated environment. This ensures that libraries and configurations for your casino-related project remain separate from other Python projects and environments.
